### Bearded Dragon OS (BDOS)

Bearded Dragon OS is a fake "simulator" OS that I'm going to use as a base for my next "simulator" OS. It's just a kernel, but it has an interpreter, and the ability to run python code.  

### How to use BDOS

Make sure you run "boot.py". This doesn't really change anything, but it makes it more realistic  
  
BDOS is pretty easy to use, just type "help" in the CLI. but if you want to run a .RUN file, you need to type run:[INT]:[filename].  
BDOS also uses colons (:) instead of spaces ( ). But other than that, it's pretty self-explanatory.
